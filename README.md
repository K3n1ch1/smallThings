# Small things

Hello! Made some little coding and wanted to post here!

## Deck Shuffler

Will generate two random cards for you! Very simple.

## Odds in 100

This has a funny history. One day I was on reddit and found a guy who made an interview, which they couldn't list the odds in 100, so I decided to make my version to see if it was that difficult... Well, it isn't.

## Total minus N

You have a starter quantity, and the program will decrement it by N until the result is the lowest number above 0.

Ex. 100 - 13 - 13 - 13 - 13 - 13 - 13 ...

Thanks by the attention!
